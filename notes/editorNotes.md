# Notes

* find what endpoints are being removed after the merge
  * eth_mining?
  * eth_hashrate
  * eth_getWork
  * eth_submitWork
  * eth_submitHashrate 

[EC-2.3] needs better wording

[EC-4] I know Eip isn't final, but I know it's implemented in geth and on track to final 

* 11.2  Make sure you don't have to have eth to be able to "deploy" a contract with eth_call not certain of current implementation

[EC-10.2] is this more of a parser issue than eth_call?


* data type information 
  
```
  type TxData interface {
	txType() byte // returns the type ID
	copy() TxData // creates a deep copy and initializes all fields

	chainID() *big.Int
	accessList() AccessList
	data() []byte
	gas() uint64
	gasPrice() *big.Int
	gasTipCap() *big.Int
	gasFeeCap() *big.Int
	value() *big.Int
	nonce() uint64
	to() *common.Address

	rawSignatureValues() (v, r, s *big.Int)
	setSignatureValues(chainID, v, r, s *big.Int)
}
```
## errors

Change error list before showing to tomasz because its JSON-RPC2 spec table

I think infura is the only implementation that uses custom error codes. NOT certain on this though

# Testing considerations
* Make sure you have tests to check every parser edge case

# Spec notes notes

Look at screenshots for information

* communicate what is needed
* Words are expensive, use least amount of words without loosing any information
* Imagine this person is new to ethereum, but knows how to code  
* Cover and note all risks and edge cases 
* Use diagrams to visualize information if needed.
* Maybe have to-be info? with post merge and l2 upgrades to the API
