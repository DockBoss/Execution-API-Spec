# API Spec Questions and Notes
This is where I write down my questions and notes that are related to sections in the EthereumExecutionLayerAPISpec.md doc

# Overall questions
 From what I can assume I am writing this doc for a post The Merge world where we are running on POS. If that is the case then there a lot of points that need to be discussed before I can complete this project

## Abstract
I think the wording the abstract can be better, but I think the content is accurate. 

## Introduction
I am having a hell of a time writing the intro

## Not specified vs Null
I think this is relevant to note to ensure everyone is on the same page regarding the terms. I am not sure where to put it or if it should be its own section though.

## input parameters
I think its helpful, but again I am not sure if where it should be located.

## References 
If I understand this section correctly its the necessary documentation that someone would need to read and understand before they can actually implement the project.

If that is the case then I think I am on the right track, but I am unsure what else to add. 

# API Types
I ended up taking some liberties into my own hands and created definitions for the different types of the Execution Layer API. I know they are not super necessary now but I think would be harder to write this document knowing very few people are going to actually implement the Standard API directly. Another reason I did this is because if we only consider the standard implementation as the correct one, then providers like Infura would be considered incorrect implementations.
## eth_syncing
I am going to re-word the las line in this section.
