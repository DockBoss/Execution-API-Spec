# 1 Introduction 

The Ethereum execution layer API is one of the key components of Ethereum. It acts as an intermediary between the users of Ethereum and the execution layer where the transactions are received and executed. It provides a way for users to send transactions, request data, and execute smart contracts. 
## 1.1 Purpose and Intended Audience

The purpose of this document is to act as a centralized source of information regarding the functional and non-functional requirements for Ethereum's execution layer API. This document is intended for development teams that are planning on implementing a version of the execution layer API. This document would also be beneficial to but is not intended for anyone interested in learning how the user interacts with Ethereum clients and at the most basic level. 

## 1.2 Scope
 
The Ethereum execution layer API provides the basis for all external interactions with the Ethereum blockchain. The interactions with the Ethereum network can be divided into four categories. Transferring ETH, deploy contracts, executing contracts, and administrative tasks. The API also provides endpoints that returns historical network and block data. 

## 1.3 Definitions and Terms
just listing them here for now not sure exactly what ones I need or don't.
I would rather have a long list that I trim than having too little
* ETH
* ERC token?
* Smart contracts
* user
* client
* EVM
* Account
* block
* block-chain

### 1.3.1 Not Specified vs Null

when the term not specified is used, it is describing the case where the parameter is not a part of the call vs when the term null is used it describes the case where the parameter is part of the call and has not been given a value

An example where `to` is not specified and `value` is null
```
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"method": "eth_call",
	"params": [{
		"from": "0x3a5509015e0193adf435a761a6ce160f900034b5",
		"value": ""
}, "latest"],
	"id": 1
}
```
### 1.3. Default Block Parameter
There are a few endpoints that need an extra `defaultBlockParameter` to specify the block that the data is being requested from.
The `defaultBlockParameter` allows the following options to specify a block:
* Block Number
* Block Hash
* Block Tag
  * earliest: for the earliest/genesis block
  * latest: for the latest mined block
  * pending: for the pending state/transactions


## 1.3.2 Input Parameters
 Input parameters for functions will be denoted by using the inline code feature of markdown and will look like `this`
## 1.4 References
* [JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)
* [Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf)
* [JSON Standard](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
* [HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/)

# 2 Overall Description

## 2.1 Product Perspective
This is an open/public api 
the JSON -RPC API is part of a bigger program.
The JSON-RPC API must interface with an ethereum execution client to send and and receive data to the Ethereum network
The users of the API will interact with the api through HTTP requests or through a web socket connection

## 2.2 Product Features 
Here is a list of standard endpoints for the Ethereum execution layer API
### Web3

## 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

* smart contract developers
* client operators
* p 


## 2.4 Operating Environment how, where, under what conditions the system would be used.
a version of the Execution layer API **MUST** be implemented with each Ethereum Execution Client.
This means that there can be multiple versions of the execution layer JSON-RPC API with different features.
This also means that for each Ethereum node running there **SHOULD** be an instance of the Execution layer API running with it to allow users to interact with it.


This is what makes this document so important. This will detail what minium features are needed to be considered a useable API implementation.

## 2.5 Design Implementations and constraints
As of writing this document the Execution layer API is currently using the JSON-RPC 2.0 standard. 
The execution layer API also supports interaction using both HTTP2.0 and WebSockets.

* when submitting tx ahead of nonce then sending correct tx that also makes the second tx not possible because of insufficient funds
  * Removes second tx from pool without having to pay extra to cancel it.

Syncing?
need to test this more

* does not effect the result of eth_hashrate, is this because I am not mining? 
* submitting hashrate while mining 
  * high
  * low
  * 0
  * null
* Try ids other clients that are mining are using.
  * I assume this errors

# Errors
Error codes between-32768 and -32000 are reserved for JSON-RPC errors, where -32000 to -32099 are for Execution layer API errors
This table has been taken from the initial version of the JSON-RPC API spec that was never finalized. 
I was told this is what **SHOULD** have ben implemented across each client. Will revise it with the actual codes once I test them all
|Code|Message|Meaning|Category|
|-|-|-|-|
|-32700|Parse error|Invalid JSON|standard|
|-32600|Invalid request|JSON is not a valid request object|standard|

|-32002|Resource unavailable|Requested resource not available|non-standard|
|-32003|Transaction rejected|Transaction creation failed|non-standard|
|-32004|Method not supported|Method is not implemented|non-standard| [looks like -32601 catches these errors]

## Questions

* I think I should add parameters for endpoint and label which ones are required and which ones are not. Not regex schema
  * I am assuming this is going to have to eventually become an EIP once it is finalized and wouldn't it look bad if we don't have all necessary information on this document?
  * I am thinking something like a parameter table with type and optional or not
  * maybe a return table with type
  * still keeping the spec we have
* I found more endpoints that are shared amongst all clients. What is the scope of this doc?
  * Is it just eth, web3, and net endpoints?
  * Or all shared endpoints like txpool, admin, personal, etc?
* Its not plagiarism if I copied the description for the block tags word for word from the eth wiki?
  * I assume not I just want to check.
* Considering re-writing the mentions of state pruning to look more like eth_getTransactionCount. 
* Would you like me to send a brief synopsis when I am done for the day?
* when I get around to testing other clients, can I create an inconsistencies doc?
  * I have a feeling that this doc is going to get messy.
* How long would you like our call on Friday to be?
  * 30?
  * 45?
  * 60?
* estimateGas
* sign
* SignTx
* SendRawTs
* SendTx
