# `eth_sendRawTransaction`



# Notes

* I need to look again, but I found some transactions that went through but returned null when I tried to get the transation recipt 
* It could be the transactions that shouldn't go through but get compiled from eth_signTransaction OR it could be another unknown issue
* This could be big or a mistake on my part
