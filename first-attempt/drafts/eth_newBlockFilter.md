# `eth_newBlockFilter`

* If the client is connected to the netwotk it **MUST** return the filter id.

# Notes

* filter id is an int that is used for all ids and the id gets incremented each time one is created. Or at least that is how geth does it
* I don't know if it is a global or local variable.
